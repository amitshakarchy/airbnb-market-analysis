# airbnb-market-analysis

In this project, our main focus in on the exploration of the Airbnb housing market and its impact on the long-term rental market. We will explore the Airbnb market, try to answer a few interesting questions, and compare the long term and the short term rental markets.

We will use several data sources, but the main ones are the following:

Airbnb Listings- The dataset contains publicly available information about how Airbnb is being used in cities around the world.
Zillow Rent List Price - The dataset contains median rental apartment prices in different locations in the US, divided into areas, number of apartment beds and months.
In some of the analyses, we will be using different versions of the same data- to gain an update data on a single city, for example.
